### Hi, I'm an Android Enginner 🛠️

#### Transforming complex requirements into elegant, maintainable Android Code.

I am an Android Developer passionate about **Clean Code** and **UI Architecture**. I believe that great user experiences are built upon solid engineering foundations.

**Technical Deep Dive:**
* 📱 **Android:** Proficient in modern Android development (Kotlin, StateFlow, Hilt).
* 📐 **Architecture:** Strong advocate for Clean Architecture and MVVM principles to ensure testability and scalability.
* 🎨 **Design & Engineering:** With a background in design thinking, I specialize in building UI frameworks that bridge the gap between design specs and implementation (Compose/View System).

**Current Stack Strategy:**
`Kotlin` • `Clean Architecture` • `Hilt` • `Coil` • `Kotlin Serialization` • `CI/CD Pipelines`

📫 **Let's talk about:** Mobile System Design, Performances, Gradle Optimizations, and Declarative UI.

**Passionate about learning new things**
